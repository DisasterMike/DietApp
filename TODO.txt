-- change LOG split after deciding name!! (in global file)

- save where the user wanted to go before forcing them to go to the login page, then redirect to there

- make sessions expire periodically
    // or
- when doing request, check if exists and valid, if not, delete?

- change home, login etc links when signed in
- make sure can't sign up or log in when already logged in

- MAKE DASHBOARD GRAB DATA FROM CORRECT user
    // need to adjust page for when the user hasn't filled out the form 
        // add a link to go to set up page if it detects missing data

-- need a dashboard page? if logged in redirect to dashboard?...

https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken - for sign in?

RESEARCH
- how to manage log in stuff...

oder... todo
-- set up schema / dbs
- create sql queries and test CRUD actions on db
- set up routes to add those / basic pages with forms/buttons
- user sign in authentication
- info questionaire (fill out profile)
- test with different accounts
- home/dashboard
- find api to get food data and add to daily amount..
- store data for test profiles (calories)
- basic styling
- create graph etc based on recorded data
- phone feature with openai to get/store food data

FONT AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!

- HIDE PASSWORD IN LOGIN/SIGNUP FORM AND REPLACE WITH *s. Have button to toggle view or not...
- forgot password button - send to email, then to reset
- when signing up - need to check if username or password is unique (sql will do this with primary keys..)

1 - send back the WHOLE html with the form info there (i guess read the html file then update the fields?)
or
2 - use fetch and json (better?) and then only have to touch cookies if sign in was successful


daily data
- user foreign key
- DATE
- calories
- weight
- some nutriants?
- food eaten (ref to other table?) // probably not necessary
    -- way to finalize and save total foods? that way users forgetting don't save just 400 kcal or somthing...


tables:
- users
username NOT NULL UNIQUE
name (first / second?) OPTIONAL
gender
age (dob) DATE
weight
height
goal weight?
weekly goal (+/- INT)???
activity level [0-4]

Sedentary	1.2	Office worker, little/no exercise - 0
Lightly Active	1.375	Light exercise (1-3 days/week) - 1
Moderately Active	1.55	Moderate exercise (3-5 days/week) - 2
Very Active	1.725	Hard exercise (6-7 days/week) - 3
Super Active	1.9	Athletes, physical labor jobs - 4

{sex, age, weight, height} = BMR
BMR * activity level = TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)

- stored food (previous eaten..?)
user foreign key
    // need join table
- id
- food info (multiple columns..)
- 

JOIN 
- user id
- food id
- how often eaten

data table? - used to show history 
user foreign key
DATE
calories eaten
weight for that day

today's food - MANY TO MANY







ideas:

- front page should have '0/2000' box always on display
    - text under saying deficit or not and how much

- dashboard has popular food choices?
    - or or favourite food items (ones you recently ate or often eat)

- once a week prompts you to enter weight?

- graphs to track progess

- set goals?
