1. **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):** This is the number of calories your body needs at rest to maintain basic functions (breathing, circulation, cell production).  
2. **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):** This includes BMR plus calories burned through physical activity.  
3. **Body Mass Index (BMI):** While BMI helps categorize weight status, it does not directly determine calorie needs.  
4. **Activity Level:** More active people require more calories.  
5. **Goals:** Whether you want to maintain, lose, or gain weight affects your calorie intake.  

### **Step 1: Calculate BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**  
The **Mifflin-St Jeor Equation** is commonly used:  

- **Men:**  
  \[
  BMR = (10 \times \text{weight in kg}) + (6.25 \times \text{height in cm}) - (5 \times \text{age in years}) + 5
  \]

;   BMR=(10×weight in kg)+(6.25×height in cm)−(5×age in years)+5

860 + 1075 - 175 + 5 = 1765
* 1.375 = 2,427 kcal/day

- **Women:**  
  \[
  BMR = (10 \times \text{weight in kg}) + (6.25 \times \text{height in cm}) - (5 \times \text{age in years}) - 161
  \]

;   BMR=(10×weight in kg)+(6.25×height in cm)−(5×age in years)−161

### **Step 2: Adjust for Activity Level (TDEE Calculation)**  
Multiply BMR by an **activity factor** to get **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):**  

| Activity Level | Multiplier |
|---------------|-----------|
| Sedentary (little to no exercise) | 1.2 |
| Lightly active (1-3 days/week exercise) | 1.375 |
| Moderately active (3-5 days/week exercise) | 1.55 |
| Very active (6-7 days/week exercise) | 1.725 |
| Super active (athletes, hard labor) | 1.9 |

\[
TDEE = BMR \times \text{activity multiplier}
\]

; TDEE=BMR×activity multiplier

### **Step 3: Adjust for Weight Goals**  
- **Maintain weight:** Eat at TDEE  
- **Lose weight:** Deficit of **250-500 kcal/day** (~0.25-0.5 kg/week)  
- **Gain weight:** Surplus of **250-500 kcal/day**
